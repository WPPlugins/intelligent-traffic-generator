== Description ==

NOTE: This is a BETA release of the plugin intended for testing of features and provision of feedback. Initial runs by several webmasters proved it to be a reliable and stable plugin that does exactly what it's intended for, however I'm gonna wait for the feedback from the public at large to see if there are any undesired interactions with other plugins and to customize functionality according to user's needs before full production version is released. I'm counting on your help - if you have tried this plugin and can see that something needs attention, please let me know asap so I can address it and move it closer to full public release.

= Plugin Description =

Intelligent Traffic Generator plug-in assists in generating effortless, targeted and focused backlinks to your WordPress blog by subconsciously encouraging internet users to post pictures from your post on their blogs, on forums they are members of, on Facebook and other social networking sites, as well as countless other interactive online media by offering them an easy and readily available, cut and paste way to do it. It is the same type of subconscious trick that successfully skyrocketed the icanhascheesburger.com website from nothing into a high traffic, PR7 blog in weeks.

The plugin skilfully yet inconspicuously increases your keyword density while keeping the flow of your text intact, boosting your chances of better Search Engine ranking without risks of having your site blacklisted for keyword spamming. It also encourages powerful link building which further boosts the possibility of better Search Engine ranking while at the same time increases traffic flow from unlimited external, yet relevant sources.

It's the best a webmaster can do for their blog and it requires no extra work on your part. Just activate it, set it up (very easy - a newb can do it in no time at all) and let it work for you while you sleep.
